# Sales and Product Analysis with Excel Interactive Dashboard

## Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive interactive dashboard built with Excel to analyze the sales performance of individual sales representatives and track sales trends across various products. The dashboard consolidates essential data metrics, enabling users to easily interpret sales volumes, compare performance among sales staff, and assess product trends over specific periods.

## Problem Statement
In a competitive market environment, it's essential to monitor and analyze both salesperson performance and product sales trends. Without clear visibility into these metrics, businesses may struggle to identify top performers, pinpoint underperforming products, and optimize sales strategies. This project addresses these challenges by providing a dashboard that:
- Offers detailed insights into individual sales contributions
- Identifies trends in product sales
- Facilitates quick comparisons and performance evaluations, enabling data-driven decision-making

## Skills Demonstrated
This project applies various Excel skills and functionalities to deliver a structured, user-friendly dashboard:
- **Data Management**: Efficiently organizing raw sales and product data for analysis.
- **Pivot Tables**: Creating aggregated views of data for quick insights across multiple dimensions.
- **Conditional Logic and Data Transformation**: Using formulas to calculate key performance metrics and transform raw data into analysis-ready formats.
- **Interactive Charts**: Developing dynamic visualizations that allow users to explore data by applying filters.

## Data Transformation and Visualization

### Data Transformation
1. **Salesmen Data Processing**:
   - The **Salesmen** sheet contains raw data on individual sales representatives, including:
     - Salesperson name
     - Total sales achieved by each representative
     - Comparative performance data for ranking and identifying top performers
   - This data is organized to provide insights into individual contributions to overall sales, highlighting both high performers and areas for improvement.

2. **Product Data Structuring**:
   - The **Product** sheet captures data on product sales, detailing:
     - Product names and categories
     - Number of units sold
     - Revenue generated per product
   - This structured data allows the dashboard to visualize product performance, enabling users to quickly identify best-selling products as well as products that may require targeted attention.

### Visualization
The **Dashboard** sheet is the core of the project, integrating data from the **Salesmen** and **Product** sheets to offer interactive charts and visualizations:
- **Salesmen Performance Comparison**: A dynamic visualization that enables filtering by variables like region and time period, making it easy to spot top sales performers.
- **Product Sales Trends**: Line charts and bar graphs that display trends for individual products, helping to highlight products with high and low sales volumes.
- **Aggregated Insights via Pivot Table**: Using pivot tables for quick access to aggregated metrics across products and sales staff.

## Dashboard Highlights
- **Interactive Filters**: Enable users to filter by different time periods, sales representatives, or products, tailoring views to specific needs.
- **Product Trend Analysis**: Visual representations of sales trends over time, helping to optimize inventory and promotional strategies based on product performance.
- **Salesmen Performance Metrics**: Compare individual sales contributions, helping management identify high performers and areas for potential coaching or development.
