# Sales and Product Performance Interactive Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is designed to provide an interactive dashboard for analyzing the sales performance of individual salesmen and the sales trends of various products. The data is structured and visualized in a way that allows for easy interpretation of key metrics such as sales volume, performance comparison, and product trends.

## Key Components

### 1. **Salesmen Performance**
The **Salesmen** sheet contains data on individual sales representatives, providing details such as:
- Salesperson name
- Total sales made by each representative
- Performance comparison between salespeople

This data allows for in-depth analysis of individual contributions to the overall sales, helping to identify top performers and areas for improvement.

### 2. **Product Sales Data**
The **Product** sheet captures product-related data, including:
- Product names and categories
- Units sold
- Revenue generated per product

By analyzing this data, the dashboard presents insights into the performance of each product in the market, helping users to identify which products are top sellers and which may need attention.

### 3. **Interactive Dashboard**
The **Dashboard** sheet is the core of the project, where interactive charts and visualizations are presented. It integrates data from the **Salesmen** and **Product** sheets to create dynamic graphs, allowing users to:
- Filter data by time periods, products, or salesmen
- Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, product performance, and individual contributions
- Compare sales trends over time

### 4. **Data Summary and Pivot Table**
The **Pivot Table** and **Data** sheets are used for summarizing and organizing the raw sales and product data:
- **Pivot Table** provides an aggregated view of sales, summarizing key metrics across products and salespeople, allowing for quick insights.
- **Data** sheet contains the foundational dataset from which the analysis is drawn, including all relevant variables for sales tracking and product categorization.

## Dashboard Highlights
- **Salesmen Performance Comparison**: Visualizes the sales performance of each salesman with the ability to filter by region, time period, or other variables, making it easy to spot top performers.
- **Product Trend Analysis**: Displays sales trends for individual products over time, helping to identify best-selling products and those that may require promotion or inventory adjustment.
- **Pivot Table Insights**: Allows users to drill down into aggregated sales data, offering a high-level summary of key metrics across various categories.

## Usage Instructions
